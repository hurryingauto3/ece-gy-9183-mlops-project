hurryingauto3: Run throught the model serving code and figure out how it could be improved or missing for a robust model serving codebase

GitHub Copilot: Okay, let's review the model serving code (model_serving) for potential improvements and missing components for robustness:

1.  **Dockerfile Best Practices:**
    *   The `COPY . /app` instruction copies the entire project context into the Docker image, including potentially large data files, training code, devops scripts, etc. This increases image size, build time, and potential security surface. It should only copy the necessary model_serving directory and any required shared code (like parts of data_pipeline if needed directly). Consider using a `.dockerignore` file.
    *   Dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, etc.) are installed directly via `pip install` without version pinning. This can lead to non-reproducible builds if dependency versions change. Create a requirements.txt with pinned versions (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`) and use `pip install -r model_serving/requirements.txt` in the Dockerfile.

2.  **Configuration Management (`mlflow_loader.py`, config.yaml):**
    *   Using environment variables (`${MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}`) is good. The template substitution in `load_config` works but is basic. Libraries like `pydantic-settings` offer more robust validation and loading from various sources (env vars, .env files, etc.).
    *   Error handling for missing/invalid config files is present, which is good.

3.  **Error Handling (`app.py`):**
    *   The `/predict` endpoint uses a broad `except Exception as e:` block. While it prevents crashes, it returns a generic 500 error with the raw exception detail (`str(e)`). This can leak internal implementation details. It's better to catch specific, expected exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError` if `get_features` fails, `ValueError` for bad input data) and return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 404, 503) with user-friendly error messages. Log the full exception internally.

4.  **Input Validation (`app.py`, predict.py):**
    *   `PredictionRequest` enforces `county` as a string and `year` as an integer. This is a good start.
    *   Further validation could be added: Is the `county` string valid (e.g., exists in the training data or a known list)? Is the `year` within a reasonable range? FastAPI's dependency injection or Pydantic validators can be used for this.
    *   predict.py assumes `get_features` returns data that can be directly put into a DataFrame. It might fail if `get_features` returns an unexpected format or raises an error.

5.  **Logging:**
    *   There's no explicit logging. Add structured logging (e.g., using Python's `logging` module) to record information about incoming requests, prediction inputs/outputs, model info used, prediction latency, and errors. This is crucial for debugging and monitoring.

6.  **Monitoring & Health Checks:**
    *   A `/model_info` endpoint exists, which is helpful.
    *   A dedicated `/health` or `/healthz` endpoint should be added. This endpoint should check critical dependencies, like whether the ML model is loaded successfully. Kubernetes and other orchestrators use health checks to manage service lifecycle.
    *   Consider adding basic metrics (e.g., request count, error rate, prediction latency) using a library compatible with Prometheus or other monitoring systems.

7.  **Dependency Coupling (`predict.py`):**
    *   predict.py directly imports `get_features` from data_pipeline. This creates a tight coupling. If the data_pipeline code changes, it could break the serving component. Options:
        *   Refactor shared logic (like feature fetching for a specific county/year) into a common library installable by both components.
        *   Have the serving component call a separate data service/API to get features.
        *   (Simpler, for now) Ensure the Dockerfile correctly copies the necessary parts of data_pipeline needed by predict.py.

8.  **Testing:**
    *   There are no apparent unit or integration tests for the model serving code. Tests should be added to verify:
        *   Correct prediction logic (`predict.py`).
        *   Configuration loading (`mlflow_loader.py`).
        *   API endpoint behavior (request/response, error handling) (`app.py`).

9.  **Drift Monitoring:**
    *   The drift.py file is empty. Implementing data and concept drift detection mechanisms is essential for maintaining model performance over time in production. This could involve logging predictions and input features for offline analysis or implementing online statistical tests.

Implementing these suggestions would significantly improve the robustness, maintainability, and observability of the model serving component.

hurryingauto3: Okay lets start making these fixes

GitHub Copilot: Okay, let's start with improving the Docker setup for the model serving component.

1.  **Create requirements.txt:**
    This file will pin the dependencies needed specifically for the model serving API.

2.  **Create `.dockerignore`:**
    This file will prevent unnecessary files (like .git, `__pycache__`, development files, large data files if they were in the root) from being copied into the Docker build context, keeping the image smaller and build faster.

3.  **Update Dockerfile:**
    Modify the Dockerfile to:
    *   Copy only the necessary application code (model_serving and the required parts of data_pipeline).
    *   Install dependencies from the new requirements.txt.

First, I'll create the requirements.txt file. I'll use the dependencies listed in the current Dockerfile. You might need to adjust the versions based on your specific environment or add dependencies required by fetch.py.

Made changes.

Next, I'll create the `.dockerignore` file in the project root directory (ece-gy-9183-mlops-project). This will exclude common files and directories that shouldn't be part of the Docker image.

Now, I'll update the Dockerfile to use the new requirements file and copy only the necessary code.

````


Made changes.

Okay, I've updated the Docker configuration.

Next, let's improve the configuration management using `pydantic-settings` and enhance app.py with better error handling, logging, input validation, and a health check endpoint.

First, I'll add `pydantic-settings` to the requirements.txt.
````
pydantic-settings>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

````


Made changes.

Okay, now I'll refactor mlflow_loader.py to use `pydantic-settings` for configuration management. This will provide better validation and structure for loading settings, primarily from environment variables.
````
import mlflow.pyfunc
import logging
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class MlflowSettings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_prefix='MLFLOW_') # Reads MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI etc.
    tracking_uri: str

    model_stage: str = "Production"       # Default value

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    mlflow: MlflowSettings = MlflowSettings()
    # Add other settings sections if needed, e.g., database, external APIs

# Load settings instance - reads from environment variables
try:
    settings = Settings()
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(settings.mlflow.tracking_uri)
    logger.info(f"MLflow tracking URI set to: {settings.mlflow.tracking_uri}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to load settings or set MLflow tracking URI: {e}")
    # Depending on the application, you might want to raise the exception
    # or exit if configuration is critical for startup.
    # For now, we log the error and proceed, load_model will likely fail later.
    settings = None # Indicate settings failed to load


def load_model():
    """
    Load the model from MLflow using the model name and stage from settings.
    """
    if not settings:
        logger.error("Cannot load model: Settings are not available.")
        return None # Or raise an exception

    try:
        uri = f"models:/{settings.mlflow.model_name}/{settings.mlflow.model_stage}"
        logger.info(f"Loading model from MLflow URI: {uri}")
        model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(uri)
        logger.info("Model loaded successfully.")
        return model
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to load model from MLflow: {e}")
        # Depending on requirements, might re-raise or return None
        return None # Indicate model loading failed

````


Made changes.

Now, I'll update app.py to incorporate the new settings, add logging, improve error handling, add basic input validation, and include a health check endpoint.

````


Made changes.

Configuration management is now handled by `pydantic-settings` loading environment variables (like `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`, `MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME`, `MLFLOW_MODEL_STAGE`). The old config.yaml file and the code to load it in mlflow_loader.py are no longer used.

I will remove the unused `load_config` function and related code from mlflow_loader.py and app.py. I'll also remove the config.yaml file itself.

First, updating mlflow_loader.py:
````
import mlflow.pyfunc
import logging
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class MlflowSettings(BaseSettings):
    # ... existing BaseSettings definition ...
    tracking_uri: str
    model_name: str = "AgriYieldPredictor" # Default value
    model_stage: str = "Production"       # Default value

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    mlflow: MlflowSettings = MlflowSettings()
    # ... existing Settings definition ...

# Load settings instance - reads from environment variables
try:
    settings = Settings()
    # ... existing try block ...
except Exception as e:
    # ... existing except block ...
    settings = None # Indicate settings failed to load

# Removed the load_config function and the old config variable

def load_model():
    # ... existing load_model function ...

````


Made changes.

Now I will remove the unused config.yaml file.I have removed the unused config.yaml file.

Now, let's add some basic error handling within predict.py to make it more robust, especially around the call to `get_features` which comes from a different part of the project (data_pipeline).
````
from data_pipeline.fetch import get_features  # import from your pipeline
import pandas as pd
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def predict_yield(model, county, year):
    try:
        logger.debug(f"Fetching features for county: {county}, year: {year}")
        features = get_features(county, year)  # dict or DataFrame
        if features is None:
            # Handle case where get_features might return None for missing data
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Features not found for county '{county}' and year {year}.")
        
        # Ensure features are in a DataFrame format for the model
        if isinstance(features, dict):
            input_df = pd.DataFrame([features])
        elif isinstance(features, pd.DataFrame):
            input_df = features # Assume it's already correct
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unexpected feature format received: {type(features)}")

        logger.debug(f"Input DataFrame for prediction:\n{input_df}")
        result = model.predict(input_df)
        # Ensure result is a scalar value as expected by the API
        if hasattr(result, '__len__') and len(result) > 0:
            return result[0]
        else:
            # Handle unexpected model output format
            logger.error(f"Unexpected model output format: {result}")
            raise ValueError("Model prediction did not return expected format.")

    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logger.warning(f"Feature fetching failed: {e}")
        raise # Re-raise FileNotFoundError to be caught by the API layer
    except ValueError as e:
        logger.error(f"Data processing or prediction error: {e}")
        raise # Re-raise ValueError to be caught by the API layer
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred in predict_yield for {county}/{year}: {e}")
        # Wrap unexpected errors in a standard exception type if needed, or re-raise
        raise RuntimeError("An internal error occurred during the prediction process.") from e

````


Made changes.

Okay, the core API logic, configuration, error handling, and Docker setup have been improved.

The next crucial steps for robustness are adding tests and addressing monitoring more formally.

1.  **Add Testing Framework:** We'll add `pytest` for testing.
2.  **Create Basic Tests:** We'll create a basic test structure and a simple test for the prediction logic, acknowledging that more comprehensive tests (including API integration tests) would be needed for a production system.
3.  **Acknowledge Drift/Metrics:** We'll add comments indicating where drift monitoring and more detailed metrics collection would be implemented.

First, let's add `pytest` to the requirements.
````
pytest>=7.0.0,<8.0.0

````


Made changes.

Okay, `pytest` has been added to the requirements.

Now, I'll create a basic test structure and a simple test for the `predict_yield` function. This requires mocking the ML model and the `get_features` function to test the prediction logic in isolation.

First, create the test directory:

hurryingauto3: Okay continue working on those tests

GitHub Copilot: Okay, I'll create the test file `model_serving/tests/test_predict.py` and add a basic test case using `pytest` and `unittest.mock`.

```python
import pytest
import pandas as pd
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

# Import the function to test
from model_serving.predict import predict_yield

@patch('model_serving.predict.get_features') # Mock the imported get_features
def test_predict_yield_success(mock_get_features):
    """
    Test the predict_yield function for a successful prediction.
    """
    # Arrange
    # Mock the ML model object
    mock_model = MagicMock()
    # Configure the mock model's predict method to return a specific value
    mock_model.predict.return_value = [45.6] # Example prediction

    # Configure the mock get_features function to return sample features
    sample_features = {'feature1': 10, 'feature2': 20}
    mock_get_features.return_value = sample_features

    test_county = "TestCounty"
    test_year = 2024

    # Act
    result = predict_yield(mock_model, test_county, test_year)

    # Assert
    # Check if get_features was called correctly
    mock_get_features.assert_called_once_with(test_county, test_year)

    # We need to be careful comparing DataFrames directly in mocks,
    # but we can check if predict was called once.

    # Optionally, inspect the argument passed to predict if needed:

    # Act & Assert
    with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError, match="Features not found"):
        predict_yield(mock_model, test_county, test_year)

    # Check if get_features was called
    mock_get_features.assert_called_once_with(test_county, test_year)
    # Ensure model.predict was NOT called
    mock_model.predict.assert_not_called()

def test_predict_yield_invalid_feature_format(mock_get_features):

    mock_get_features.assert_called_once_with(test_county, test_year)
    # Ensure model.predict was NOT called
    mock_model.predict.assert_not_called()

```

This sets up a basic test suite for the core prediction logic. You can run these tests using `pytest` in your terminal from the project root directory:

```bash
python -m pytest model_serving/tests/
```

Remember to ensure `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` is set in your environment if tests indirectly trigger parts of `mlflow_loader.py`, although these specific tests mock out the parts that would require it.

Finally, let's add placeholders for drift detection and metrics in the relevant files.

In [`model_serving/drift.py`](model_serving/drift.py ):
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def check_data_drift(input_data):
    """
    Placeholder for data drift detection logic.
    Compares incoming prediction request data characteristics
    against the training data baseline.
    """
    # TODO: Implement data drift detection (e.g., using statistical tests like KS, PSI)
    # This might involve loading baseline statistics calculated during training.
    logger.info("Data drift check not implemented.")
    pass

def check_concept_drift(prediction_result, ground_truth):
    """
    Placeholder for concept drift detection logic.
    Compares model predictions against actual outcomes (if available later).
    Requires a mechanism to collect ground truth and associate it with predictions.
    """
    # TODO: Implement concept drift detection (e.g., monitoring prediction accuracy/error rates)
    # This often happens offline or requires a feedback loop.
    logger.info("Concept drift check not implemented.")
    pass

def log_prediction_for_monitoring(request_data, prediction):
    """
    Log input features and prediction output for offline analysis,
    monitoring, and potential drift detection.
    """
    # TODO: Implement logging to a dedicated monitoring store (database, log file, etc.)
    # Ensure sensitive data is handled appropriately.
    logger.debug(f"Logging prediction - Input: {request_data}, Output: {prediction}")
    pass

```

In [`model_serving/app.py`](model_serving/app.py ), add calls to these placeholders:

This completes the initial round of improvements focusing on Docker, configuration, error handling, logging, basic testing, and setting up placeholders for monitoring and drift detection.

hurryingauto3: Make these changes!

Made changes.

hurryingauto3: I want to make use of poetry in my model serving instead of requirements.txt

GitHub Copilot: Okay, let's switch the model_serving component to use Poetry.

1.  **Create `pyproject.toml`:** I'll create a `model_serving/pyproject.toml` file and populate it with the dependencies from your requirements.txt. `pytest` will be marked as a development dependency.

    ```toml
    # filepath: /Users/aliha/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/nyu/tandon/spring-2025/ece-gy-9183-mlops-project/model_serving/pyproject.toml
    [tool.poetry]
    name = "model-serving"
    version = "0.1.0"
    description = "FastAPI service for AgriYield model prediction"
    authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"] # Please update author info
    readme = "README.md" # Optional: Add a README specific to model_serving if desired
    packages = [{include = "model_serving"}]

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = "^3.10"
    fastapi = ">=0.100.0,<0.111.0"
    uvicorn = {extras = ["standard"], version = ">=0.20.0,<0.28.0"}
    pydantic = ">=2.0.0,<3.0.0"
    mlflow = ">=2.0.0,<3.0.0"
    pandas = ">=1.5.0,<2.3.0"
    requests = ">=2.28.0,<2.32.0"
    PyYAML = ">=6.0,<7.0"
    pydantic-settings = ">=2.0.0,<3.0.0"
    # Add data_pipeline dependencies here if needed directly by model_serving
    # Example: If data_pipeline/fetch.py needs 'some-library', add it:
    # some-library = "^1.2.3"

    [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
    pytest = ">=7.0.0,<8.0.0"

    [build-system]
    requires = ["poetry-core"]
    build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

    ```

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

````


Made changes.

Okay, the `pyproject.toml` file has been created for the model_serving component.

Next, I'll update the Dockerfile to use Poetry for dependency management. This involves installing Poetry, copying the `pyproject.toml` and the `poetry.lock` file (which you'll need to generate), and then running `poetry install`.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Install poetry
ENV POETRY_VERSION=1.7.1 # Or choose a specific version
RUN pip install "poetry==${POETRY_VERSION}"

WORKDIR /app

# Copy project definition and lock file
COPY model_serving/pyproject.toml model_serving/poetry.lock* /app/model_serving/

# Copy only the necessary application code
# Ensure the paths are relative to the build context (project root)
COPY model_serving /app/model_serving
COPY data_pipeline/__init__.py /app/data_pipeline/
COPY data_pipeline/fetch.py /app/data_pipeline/

ENV MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=${MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}
# Set PYTHONPATH to include the app directory so imports work
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app

# Change working directory for poetry commands
WORKDIR /app/model_serving

# Install dependencies using poetry
# --no-root: Don't install the project itself as editable, just dependencies
# --no-dev: Don't install development dependencies (like pytest) in the final image
RUN poetry install --no-root --no-dev

# Change back to the main app directory if needed, or adjust CMD path
WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 8000
# Adjust the CMD to point to the app within the model_serving directory
# Ensure the path reflects the structure inside the container
CMD ["uvicorn", "model_serving.app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Now, I will remove the old requirements.txt file as it's replaced by `pyproject.toml`.

**Important:** Before building the Docker image, you need to generate the `poetry.lock` file. Navigate to the model_serving directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
poetry lock
```

This command resolves all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` and creates the `poetry.lock` file, which ensures that exactly the same versions of dependencies are installed every time. Make sure to commit both `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` to your version control system.

hurryingauto3: Write a readme for model serving

GitHub Copilot: Okay, I will create a README.md file within the model_serving directory to document this part of the project.
````
# Model Serving - AgriYield API

This directory contains the code for the FastAPI application that serves the trained AgriYield prediction model.

## Overview

The service exposes a REST API to get yield predictions based on county and year. It loads the appropriate model version from an MLflow Tracking Server and uses features fetched via the `data_pipeline` component.

## Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

1.  **Install Poetry:** Follow the instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to this directory (`model_serving`) in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This will install all required dependencies, including development dependencies like `pytest`.

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variable to be set:

*   `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`: The URI of the MLflow Tracking Server where the models are registered.
*   `MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME`: (Optional) The name of the model in MLflow. Defaults to `AgriYieldPredictor`.
*   `MLFLOW_MODEL_STAGE`: (Optional) The stage of the model to load (e.g., `Production`, `Staging`). Defaults to `Production`.

You can set these variables directly in your environment or use a `.env` file (Poetry automatically loads `.env` files if `python-dotenv` is installed, or you can manage it manually).

## Running Locally

To run the API server locally for development:

1.  Ensure dependencies are installed (`poetry install`).
2.  Set the required environment variables (e.g., `export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=...`).
3.  Run the Uvicorn server from the **project root directory** (to ensure correct imports from `data_pipeline`):
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn model_serving.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    The `--reload` flag automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected.

## Running with Docker

A Dockerfile is provided to containerize the application.

1.  **Generate Lock File:** Make sure you have generated the `poetry.lock` file:
    ```bash
    cd model_serving
    poetry lock
    cd ..
    ```
2.  **Build the Image:** From the project root directory:
    ```bash
    docker build -t agriyield-api -f model_serving/Dockerfile .
    ```
3.  **Run the Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=<your_mlflow_uri> agriyield-api
    ```
    Replace `<your_mlflow_uri>` with your actual MLflow server URI.

## API Endpoints

*   **`POST /predict`**: Get a yield prediction.
    *   Request Body (JSON):
        ```json
        {
          "county": "SomeCounty",
          "year": 2023
        }
        ```
    *   Success Response (200 OK):
        ```json
        {
          "county": "SomeCounty",
          "year": 2023,
          "predicted_yield": 45.67
        }
        ```
    *   Error Responses: `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`, `503 Service Unavailable`.
*   **`GET /health`**: Health check endpoint.
    *   Success Response (200 OK):
        ```json
        {
          "status": "ok"
        }
        ```
    *   Error Response: `503 Service Unavailable` (if the model isn't loaded).
*   **`GET /model_info`**: Get information about the loaded model.
    *   Success Response (200 OK):
        ```json
        {
          "model_name": "AgriYieldPredictor",
          "model_stage": "Production",
          "mlflow_uri": "http://your_mlflow_uri"
        }
        ```

## Testing

Tests are located in the `model_serving/tests` directory and use `pytest`.

1.  Ensure development dependencies are installed (`poetry install`).
2.  Run tests from the **project root directory**:
    ```bash
    poetry run python -m pytest model_serving/tests/
    ```

## Monitoring & Drift

Basic logging is implemented. Placeholders for data drift detection (`drift.py`) and metrics collection exist within the code (`app.py`). These would need to be fully implemented for a production system, potentially integrating with tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

````


Made changes.

I have created the README.md file in the model_serving directory with instructions on setup, configuration, running the service locally and with Docker, API endpoints, testing, and monitoring.

hurryingauto3: Okay now analyze the codebase here and figure out how the model serving part can be improved

GitHub Copilot: Based on the current structure and previous changes, here are further potential improvements for the model_serving component:

1.  **Decouple from data_pipeline:**
    *   **Problem:** The Dockerfile copies specific files (`__init__.py`, `fetch.py`) from data_pipeline. This creates a tight coupling and makes the build process fragile. If `fetch.py` changes its own dependencies or internal structure, the model_serving build might break or require manual updates.
    *   **Suggestion:** Treat the shared functionality (like `get_features`) as a separate library. Package the relevant parts of data_pipeline (or a new shared `common` library) and install it via Poetry in pyproject.toml. Alternatively, expose `get_features` via its own dedicated microservice/API that the model_serving API calls.

2.  **Docker Image Optimization:**
    *   **Problem:** The current Dockerfile installs Poetry and then uses it to install dependencies within the same layer. The final image contains Poetry itself and potentially build-time dependencies, increasing its size. It also likely runs as the root user.
    *   **Suggestion:** Implement a multi-stage Docker build.
        *   Stage 1: Use a base image with Python and Poetry, copy `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`, install dependencies including dev dependencies if needed for building. Export the runtime dependencies using `poetry export`.
        *   Stage 2: Use a clean, slim Python base image (like `python:3.10-slim`), create a non-root user, copy the exported requirements.txt from Stage 1, install dependencies using `pip`, copy the application code (model_serving and necessary parts of data_pipeline *if not decoupled*), and set the `CMD` to run as the non-root user.

3.  **Asynchronous API Endpoints:**
    *   **Problem:** The `/predict` endpoint is synchronous (`def`). If `get_features` or `model.predict` involves I/O or significant computation, it can block the server thread, limiting concurrency.
    *   **Suggestion:** Change the endpoint definition to `async def get_prediction(...)`. This requires that the functions called within it (`get_features`, `model.predict`) are also awaitable or run in a thread pool executor (FastAPI handles standard function calls in `async def` endpoints this way automatically, but explicit async I/O in `get_features` would be better). MLflow's `pyfunc.load_model` doesn't inherently support async prediction, so wrapping the `model.predict` call might be necessary if it's blocking.

4.  **Enhanced Testing:**
    *   **Problem:** Only unit tests for `predict.py` exist. The API endpoints, request/response validation, error handling, and integration with `mlflow_loader` are not tested.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add integration tests using FastAPI's `TestClient`. Create tests in `model_serving/tests/test_app.py` that simulate HTTP requests to `/predict`, `/health`, and `/model_info`, mocking external dependencies like `load_model` and `get_features` as needed, and asserting the expected HTTP responses and status codes.

5.  **Monitoring & Metrics Implementation:**
    *   **Problem:** Placeholders for monitoring and drift exist but are not implemented.
    *   **Suggestion:** Integrate a library like `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`. Add it to `pyproject.toml`, instrument the FastAPI app in `app.py` to automatically expose standard metrics (request count, latency histograms, errors) on a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping. Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) to facilitate log aggregation and analysis.

6.  **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Problem:** The API appears to have no authentication or authorization. If deployed externally, it's open. Dependencies might have vulnerabilities. The container runs as root.
    *   **Suggestion:**
        *   Implement basic security if needed (e.g., API Key checking using FastAPI's `Security` dependencies).
        *   Add rate limiting (e.g., using `slowapi`).
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities (`poetry check`, external tools).
        *   Implement the non-root user suggestion in the Dockerfile.

7.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   **Problem:** While `pydantic-settings` is used, ensure no sensitive information or critical configuration defaults are hardcoded directly in the source files (`app.py`, `mlflow_loader.py`).
    *   **Suggestion:** Double-check that all configurable parameters (model names, stages, external service URLs if decoupling occurs, etc.) are loaded via the `Settings` object derived from environment variables or configuration files.

hurryingauto3: Lets work on implementing these features. Assume get features is an API from another service. No auth is needed. I do want to set this service up for scale so it definitely neesd to be ready for batch inference etc

GitHub Copilot: Okay, let's refactor the model_serving component to fetch features from an external API, make the prediction endpoint asynchronous, and prepare for batch inference.

**1. Update Configuration for Feature Service URL**

First, I'll add `httpx` for making asynchronous HTTP requests and update the configuration to include the URL for the feature service.

Add `httpx` to pyproject.toml:
```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
# ...existing dependencies...
httpx = ">=0.25.0,<0.28.0"
# ...existing dependencies...

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
# ...existing dev dependencies...
```

Update mlflow_loader.py to include the feature service URL in settings:
```python
import mlflow.pyfunc
import logging
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict
from pydantic import HttpUrl # Import HttpUrl for validation

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class MlflowSettings(BaseSettings):
    # ... existing MlflowSettings ...
    tracking_uri: str
    model_name: str = "AgriYieldPredictor"
    model_stage: str = "Production"

class FeatureServiceSettings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_prefix='FEATURE_SERVICE_')
    url: HttpUrl # Use HttpUrl for validation, reads FEATURE_SERVICE_URL

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    mlflow: MlflowSettings = MlflowSettings()
    feature_service: FeatureServiceSettings = FeatureServiceSettings()
    # Add other settings sections if needed

# Load settings instance - reads from environment variables
try:
    settings = Settings()
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(settings.mlflow.tracking_uri)
    logger.info(f"MLflow tracking URI set to: {settings.mlflow.tracking_uri}")
    logger.info(f"Feature Service URL set to: {settings.feature_service.url}")
except Exception as e:
    # ... existing error handling ...
    settings = None # Indicate settings failed to load

def load_model():
    # ... existing load_model function ...
```

**2. Refactor predict.py for Async API Call**

Now, modify predict.py to make an asynchronous call to the feature service API using `httpx`.

```python
# Removed: from data_pipeline.fetch import get_features
import pandas as pd
import logging
import httpx # Import httpx
from model_serving.mlflow_loader import settings # Import settings to get URL

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Create a reusable async client
async_client = httpx.AsyncClient()

async def get_features_from_api(county: str, year: int) -> dict | None:
    """Fetches features for a given county and year from the feature service API."""
    if not settings or not settings.feature_service.url:
        logger.error("Feature service URL is not configured.")
        raise RuntimeError("Feature service is not configured.")

    # Construct the URL (adjust path and query params as needed by the actual feature service)
    # Example: http://features:9000/features?county=SomeCounty&year=2023
    feature_url = f"{settings.feature_service.url}/features" # Assuming /features endpoint
    params = {"county": county, "year": year}

    try:
        logger.debug(f"Fetching features from {feature_url} with params: {params}")
        response = await async_client.get(feature_url, params=params, timeout=10.0) # Add timeout
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise exception for 4xx or 5xx status codes
        features = response.json()
        logger.debug(f"Received features: {features}")
        return features
    except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 404:
            logger.warning(f"Feature service returned 404 for {county}/{year}")
            # Raise specific exception that the API layer can catch
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Features not found via API for county '{county}' and year {year}.")
        else:
            logger.error(f"HTTP error fetching features for {county}/{year}: {e}")
            raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to fetch features from API: {e}")
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        logger.error(f"Request error fetching features for {county}/{year}: {e}")
        raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to connect to feature service: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Unexpected error fetching features for {county}/{year}: {e}")
        raise RuntimeError("An unexpected error occurred while fetching features.")


async def predict_yield(model, county: str, year: int) -> float:
    """Predicts yield by fetching features from API and running the model."""
    try:
        # Fetch features asynchronously
        features = await get_features_from_api(county, year)
        if features is None: # Should be handled by exceptions in get_features_from_api now
             raise FileNotFoundError(f"Features could not be retrieved for county '{county}' and year {year}.")

        # Ensure features are in a DataFrame format for the model
        if isinstance(features, dict):
            input_df = pd.DataFrame([features])
        # Add handling if API returns list of features for single request? Unlikely but possible.
        # elif isinstance(features, list) and len(features) == 1 and isinstance(features[0], dict):
        #     input_df = pd.DataFrame(features)
        else:
            # If API returns DataFrame json (e.g., split format), handle it
            try:
                input_df = pd.read_json(features, orient='split') # Example if API returns df.to_json(orient='split')
            except Exception:
                 raise ValueError(f"Unexpected feature format received from API: {type(features)}")

        logger.debug(f"Input DataFrame for prediction:\n{input_df}")

        # Run prediction (model.predict might be blocking)
        # FastAPI runs sync functions in threadpool when called from async route
        result = model.predict(input_df)

        # Ensure result is a scalar value as expected by the API
        if hasattr(result, '__len__') and len(result) > 0:
            # TODO: Consider adding type checking for the prediction result (e.g., ensure it's float/numeric)
            return float(result[0]) # Cast to float
        else:
            logger.error(f"Unexpected model output format: {result}")
            raise ValueError("Model prediction did not return expected format.")

    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError) as e: # Catch specific, expected errors
        logger.warning(f"Prediction failed for {county}/{year}: {e}")
        raise # Re-raise specific errors for the API layer
    except RuntimeError as e: # Catch errors from feature fetching
         logger.error(f"Prediction failed due to runtime error for {county}/{year}: {e}")
         raise # Re-raise runtime errors
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred in predict_yield for {county}/{year}: {e}")
        raise RuntimeError("An internal error occurred during the prediction process.") from e

# TODO: Add predict_yield_batch function here later
```

**3. Update app.py for Async Endpoint**

Modify the `/predict` endpoint in app.py to be asynchronous.

```python
import logging
import time
import asyncio # Import asyncio for potential batching later
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Request, status
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator, HttpUrl
from model_serving.predict import predict_yield # predict_yield is now async
from model_serving.mlflow_loader import load_model, settings
from model_serving.drift import check_data_drift, log_prediction_for_monitoring

# ... (logging configuration, app setup, model loading) ...

# Middleware for logging requests (remains async)
@app.middleware("http")
async def log_requests(request: Request, call_next):
    # ... existing middleware code ...
    return response

class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    # ... existing PredictionRequest model ...

# --- Make the endpoint async ---
@app.post("/predict")
async def get_prediction(req: PredictionRequest): # Changed to async def
    if model is None:
        # ... existing model load check ...

    try:
        # --- Monitoring/Drift ---

```

**4. Update Dockerfile (Remove data_pipeline Copy)**

Remove the lines copying data_pipeline files from Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

# ... (Install poetry) ...

WORKDIR /app

# Copy project definition and lock file
COPY model_serving/pyproject.toml model_serving/poetry.lock* /app/model_serving/

# Copy only the model_serving application code
COPY model_serving /app/model_serving
# --- Removed data_pipeline copy lines ---

# ... (Set ENV vars, install dependencies with poetry, set WORKDIR, EXPOSE, CMD) ...
```

**5. Update Tests (Conceptual)**

The tests in test_predict.py need to be updated:

*   They need to be `async def` tests.
*   Instead of `@patch('model_serving.predict.get_features')`, you'll need to mock the `httpx.AsyncClient.get` call, likely using a library like `pytest-httpx` or manually patching `httpx.AsyncClient`. The mock should simulate the responses (success, 404, other errors) from the feature service API.

*(Applying these test changes requires adding `pytest-asyncio` and potentially `pytest-httpx` to dev dependencies and rewriting the test structure, which I'll skip for now unless you want to proceed with that specifically.)*

**Summary of Changes:**

*   Added `httpx` dependency.
*   Configured the Feature Service URL via environment variables (`FEATURE_SERVICE_URL`).
*   Refactored predict.py to fetch features asynchronously from the configured URL.
*   Made the `/predict` endpoint in app.py asynchronous.
*   Removed the direct dependency on data_pipeline code from the Docker build.
*   Added graceful shutdown for the `httpx` client.

Remember to set the `FEATURE_SERVICE_URL` environment variable when running the application or tests.

Next, we can implement the `/predict_batch` endpoint and the multi-stage Docker build.

hurryingauto3: Update my tests too

GitHub Copilot: Okay, let's update the tests in test_predict.py to work with the asynchronous changes and the new `get_features_from_api` function.

First, I'll add `pytest-asyncio` to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml so `pytest` can run async tests.

Made changes.

Okay, the tests have been updated to work with the asynchronous `predict_yield` function and mock the API call.

Now, let's implement the batch prediction endpoint.

**1. Add Batch Prediction Logic to predict.py**

I'll add a new function `predict_yield_batch` to predict.py. This function will handle fetching features concurrently for multiple requests, running the model once on the combined features, and mapping results back.

```python
import pandas as pd
import logging

    # Create tasks to fetch features concurrently

        county = req.get("county")
        year = req.get("year")
        if county and year:
            # Store index along with the task
            feature_tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(get_features_from_api(county, year), name=f"fetch_{i}"))
            original_indices.append(i)
        else:
            # Handle invalid request item immediately

        return results

    # Run prediction on the batch DataFrame
    try:

        logger.info(f"Batch prediction successful for {len(valid_features)} items.")

        # Ensure prediction output matches the number of valid inputs
        if len(batch_predictions) != len(valid_features):
             raise ValueError(f"Model returned {len(batch_predictions)} predictions for {len(valid_features)} inputs.")

        # Map predictions back to the original request indices
        for i, prediction in enumerate(batch_predictions):
            original_index = valid_indices[i]
            request_info = {"county": requests[original_index]["county"], "year": requests[original_index]["year"]}
            try:

            results[idx] = {**request_info, "error": "Internal error during batch prediction."}

    return results
```

**2. Add Batch Endpoint to app.py**

Now, I'll define the Pydantic models for the batch request/response and add the `/predict_batch` endpoint to app.py.

```python
import logging
import time
import asyncio
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Request, status
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator, HttpUrl, Field # Import Field
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional # Import List, Dict, Any, Optional
# Import batch function
from model_serving.predict import predict_yield, predict_yield_batch
from model_serving.mlflow_loader import load_model, settings
from model_serving.drift import check_data_drift, log_prediction_for_monitoring

# ... (logging configuration, app setup, model loading, middleware) ...

class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    # ... existing PredictionRequest model ...

# --- Define Batch Request Model ---
class BatchPredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    requests: List[PredictionRequest] = Field(..., min_length=1) # Ensure at least one request

# --- Define Batch Response Item Model ---
class BatchPredictionResponseItem(BaseModel):
    county: str
    year: int
    predicted_yield: Optional[float] = None # Prediction is optional
    error: Optional[str] = None # Error message is optional

# --- Define Batch Response Model ---
class BatchPredictionResponse(BaseModel):
    responses: List[BatchPredictionResponseItem]


@app.post("/predict")
async def get_prediction(req: PredictionRequest):
    # ... existing single prediction endpoint ...

# --- Add Batch Prediction Endpoint ---
@app.post("/predict_batch", response_model=BatchPredictionResponse)
async def get_batch_predictions(batch_req: BatchPredictionRequest):
    if model is None:
        logger.error("Batch prediction failed: Model is not loaded.")
        # Return error for all items in the batch
        error_response = [{"county": r.county, "year": r.year, "error": "Model is not loaded. Service unavailable."} for r in batch_req.requests]
        return BatchPredictionResponse(responses=error_response)
        # Or raise 503 directly, but providing per-item errors might be better for batch
        # raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, detail="Model is not loaded. Service unavailable.")

    try:
        logger.info(f"Received batch prediction request with {len(batch_req.requests)} items.")
        # Convert Pydantic models to dicts for the processing function
        request_dicts = [req.model_dump() for req in batch_req.requests]

        # --- Monitoring/Drift (Apply per item or sample?) ---
        # For now, maybe check drift on the first item as a sample
        if request_dicts:
             check_data_drift(request_dicts[0])
        # TODO: Implement more robust batch drift checking/sampling strategy
        # ----------------------------------------------------

        # --- Await the async batch function ---
        results = await predict_yield_batch(model, request_dicts)
        logger.info(f"Batch prediction processing completed for {len(batch_req.requests)} items.")

        # --- Monitoring/Logging (Log summary or per item?) ---
        # TODO: Implement batch logging strategy
        # Example: Log counts of success/failure
        success_count = sum(1 for r in results if "predicted_yield" in r and r["predicted_yield"] is not None)
        failure_count = len(results) - success_count
        logger.info(f"Batch results - Success: {success_count}, Failed: {failure_count}")
        # Optionally log individual results if needed, be mindful of log volume
        # for res in results:
        #     log_prediction_for_monitoring(res, res.get("predicted_yield")) # Adapt logging function if needed
        # ------------------------------------------------------

        # Wrap results in the response model
        return BatchPredictionResponse(responses=results)

    except Exception as e:
        # Catch unexpected errors during the overall batch processing
        logger.exception(f"An unexpected error occurred during batch prediction for request size {len(batch_req.requests)}: {e}")
        # Return a generic error for all items, as the specific failure point is unknown
        error_response = [{"county": r.county, "year": r.year, "error": "An internal error occurred during batch processing."} for r in batch_req.requests]
        # It might be better to return 500 directly here instead of masking as per-item errors
        # raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, detail="An internal error occurred during batch prediction.")
        return BatchPredictionResponse(responses=error_response) # Or raise 500


@app.get("/model_info")
def model_info():
    # ... existing model_info endpoint ...

@app.get("/health", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
def health_check():
    # ... existing health_check endpoint ...

@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    # ... existing shutdown event ...
    # Need to access the client via the predict module
    from model_serving import predict as predict_module
    logger.info("Closing httpx client...")
    await predict_module.async_client.aclose()
    logger.info("Httpx client closed.")

```

**3. Update app.py Shutdown Handler**

I noticed the shutdown handler in app.py was trying to access `predict_yield.async_client`. Since `predict_yield` is a function, we need to access the client via the module itself. I've corrected this in the snippet above.

Now the service supports both single (`/predict`) and batch (`/predict_batch`) predictions asynchronously, fetching features from an external API.

Next, I will implement the multi-stage Docker build.

Made changes.

Okay, the multi-stage Dockerfile is now set up.

Let's move on to enhancing the testing by adding integration tests for the FastAPI application itself using `TestClient`. This will test the API endpoints, request/response validation, and status codes.

First, I'll add `pytest-httpx` to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml. This library helps mock HTTP requests made by `httpx`, which is useful for testing the interaction with the feature service API.
````
pytest-httpx = "^0.21.0" # Add dependency for mocking httpx requests
````


Made changes.

Okay, I've added `pytest-httpx` to your development dependencies.

Now, I'll create the integration test file `#model_serving/tests/test_app.py` and add tests for the API endpoints using FastAPI's `TestClient` and `pytest-httpx` to mock the feature service calls.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Patch `load_model`:** We patch `model_serving.mlflow_loader.load_model` *before* importing the `app` to prevent the actual model loading during test setup. We provide a `MagicMock` as the return value.
2.  **`TestClient` Fixture:** A pytest fixture `client` creates an instance of `TestClient(app)`. It also patches the `settings` within its scope to ensure predictable configuration (like the feature service URL) during tests.
3.  **`pytestmark = pytest.mark.asyncio`:** Marks all tests in the file to be run using `pytest-asyncio`.
4.  **`httpx_mock` Fixture:** Provided by `pytest-httpx`, this allows mocking specific HTTP requests. We use `httpx_mock.add_response(...)` to define the expected response (JSON data or status code) for specific URLs requested by the `get_features_from_api` function.
5.  **Async Test Functions:** Test functions are defined with `async def`.
6.  **`await client.post(...)`:** When making requests with `TestClient` to async endpoints, use `await`.
7.  **Mocking Model Output:** Inside specific tests, you can configure the `mock_model.predict.return_value` to match the expected output for that test case (e.g., different values for single vs. batch).
8.  **Assertions:** Tests assert the expected `status_code` and JSON `detail` or body from the API response.

Now you can run these integration tests alongside your unit tests using:

```bash
poetry run python -m pytest model_serving/tests/
```

This provides much better coverage by testing the actual API behavior, including request validation, routing, dependency injection (like the model), error handling, and interaction with the (mocked) external feature service.

Made changes.

Okay, the integration tests for the API endpoints have been added.

Now, let's implement basic monitoring by adding Prometheus metrics using the `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` library. This will automatically expose common metrics like request counts, latency, and errors on a `/metrics` endpoint.

First, add the dependency to pyproject.toml.
````
prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator = "^6.1.0" # For Prometheus metrics
````


Made changes.

Okay, the dependency is added. Now, I'll instrument the FastAPI app in app.py to expose the Prometheus metrics endpoint.

Made changes.

Okay, Prometheus metrics have been added. When you run the service, a `/metrics` endpoint will be available for scraping by a Prometheus server.

As a further step towards robustness and security, let's add basic rate limiting to the API endpoints using the `slowapi` library. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage.

First, add the dependency to pyproject.toml.
````
slowapi = "^0.1.9" # For rate limiting
````


Made changes.

Okay, the `slowapi` dependency has been added.

Now, I'll integrate rate limiting into app.py. We'll apply a simple default limit (e.g., 10 requests per minute per IP address) to the prediction endpoints.

```python
import logging
import time
import asyncio
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Request, status
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator, HttpUrl, Field
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
# Import batch function

# --- Configure Rate Limiting ---

app = FastAPI(title="AgriYield Model API")

# --- Add Rate Limiting State and Middleware/Handler ---
# State is required by the middleware
app.state.limiter = limiter
# Add the exception handler for RateLimitExceeded
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)
# Add the middleware to process requests
# IMPORTANT: Add SlowAPIMiddleware *before* the Prometheus instrumentator middleware if you want
# requests blocked by rate limiting *not* to be counted in Prometheus metrics.
# If you want blocked requests counted, add it *after*. Let's add it before.

# No rate limit applied to health
def health_check():

@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    # ... existing shutdown event ...

```

**Key Changes:**

1.  **Import `slowapi`:** Imported necessary components.
2.  **Create `Limiter`:** Initialized a `Limiter` using the client's remote address (`get_remote_address`) as the key and set a default limit (which isn't used directly here but is good practice).
3.  **Add State & Middleware:** Added the `limiter` to the app's state (`app.state.limiter`), registered the exception handler for `RateLimitExceeded`, and added the `SlowAPIMiddleware`. The middleware is added *before* the Prometheus instrumentator.
4.  **Decorate Endpoints:** Added the `@limiter.limit("...")` decorator to the `/predict` (10/minute) and `/predict_batch` (5/minute) endpoints. Note that the `request: Request` parameter must be added to the function signature for the decorator to work correctly.
5.  **No Limits on Health/Info:** The `/health` and `/model_info` endpoints are intentionally left without rate limits.

Now, if a client exceeds the specified rate limit for `/predict` or `/predict_batch`, they will receive an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" error.

Made changes.

Okay, the rate limiting has been added to the prediction endpoints.

Let's refine the logging to use a structured format like JSON, which is more easily parsed by log aggregation systems. We'll use the `structlog` library for this.

First, add `structlog` to the dependencies in pyproject.toml.
````
structlog = "^23.0.0" # For structured logging
````


Made changes.

Okay, `structlog` has been added. Now, I'll configure it in app.py to replace the standard logging setup and ensure logs are output as JSON. I'll also update the logging calls in the other relevant files.

**1. Configure `structlog` in app.py**

```

**Key Changes:**

1.  **`structlog.configure`:** Sets up the basic processing pipeline and JSON rendering in app.py.
2.  **Standard Logging Handler:** Configures the root Python logger to use `structlog`'s formatter, ensuring logs go to stdout as JSON.
3.  **`structlog.get_logger()`:** Used in each module (`app.py`, predict.py, mlflow_loader.py) to get a logger instance.
4.  **Structured Calls:** Replaced `logger.info(...)`, `logger.warning(...)`, etc., with `structlog` calls, passing data as keyword arguments (e.g., `logger.info("message", key=value)`).
5.  **Context Binding:**
    *   In app.py middleware, request-specific info (`method`, `path`, `client_ip`) is bound using `structlog.contextvars.bind_contextvars` so it appears in all logs for that request.
    *   In endpoint handlers (`get_prediction`, `get_batch_predictions`), prediction-specific info (`county`, `year`, `batch_size`) is bound.
    *   In predict.py, context (`county`, `year`, `item_index`) is bound at the start of functions or within loops using `logger.bind()` to create context-aware loggers (`log`, `item_log`).
6.  **Exception Logging:** `logger.exception(...)` automatically includes traceback information in the structured log. `exc_info=True` can be added to other log levels (`error`, `warning`) to include tracebacks manually.

Now, when you run the application, logs will be output in JSON format, including the standard log level, logger name, timestamp, the message, and any key-value pairs added as context or arguments to the logging call. This makes them much easier to parse and analyze with log management tools.

Made changes.

Okay, the structured logging setup is now complete across the relevant files in model_serving.

The next step to improve robustness, especially for deployment in orchestrated environments like Kubernetes, is to enhance the `/health` check. Currently, it only verifies if the ML model object is loaded. A more comprehensive check should also verify connectivity to critical dependencies, such as the Feature Service API we now rely on.

I'll modify the `/health` endpoint in `#model_serving/app.py` to make a quick check (e.g., an HTTP HEAD or OPTIONS request) to the base URL of the Feature Service.

```python
# ... other imports ...
from model_serving.predict import async_client # Import the httpx client instance

# ... (structlog configuration, rate limiting, app setup, prometheus, model loading, middleware) ...

# ... (Pydantic models) ...

# ... (/predict endpoint) ...

# ... (/predict_batch endpoint) ...

# ... (/model_info endpoint) ...


# --- Updated Health Check ---
@app.get("/health", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
async def health_check(): # Changed to async def
    """Checks model loading and basic connectivity to the Feature Service."""
    if model is None:
        logger.error("Health check failed: Model is not loaded.")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, detail="Dependency failed: Model is not loaded")

    # Check connectivity to Feature Service
    if settings and settings.feature_service.url:
        feature_service_ok = False
        try:
            # Use a quick HEAD request to check reachability without fetching data
            # Use the base URL from settings
            base_url = str(settings.feature_service.url).rstrip('/') + "/" # Ensure trailing slash for base check if needed
            # Use the shared httpx client instance from predict.py
            response = await async_client.head(base_url, timeout=5.0) # Short timeout
            # Consider status 4xx as potentially 'ok' from connectivity standpoint, but log warning
            if response.status_code < 500:
                 feature_service_ok = True
                 if response.status_code >= 400:
                      logger.warning("Health check: Feature service reachable but returned client error status", status_code=response.status_code, url=base_url)
            else:
                 logger.error("Health check failed: Feature service returned server error status", status_code=response.status_code, url=base_url)

        except httpx.RequestError as e:
            logger.error("Health check failed: Could not connect to Feature Service", error=str(e), url=base_url)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception("Health check failed: Unexpected error during Feature Service check") # Log other errors

        if not feature_service_ok:
             raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, detail="Dependency failed: Cannot reach Feature Service")
    else:
        # If feature service URL is not configured, maybe it's optional? Or should fail?
        # For now, let's assume it's critical if configured. If not configured, pass this check.
        logger.warning("Health check: Feature Service URL not configured, skipping connectivity check.")


    # If all checks pass
    logger.debug("Health check successful")
    return {"status": "ok"}


@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    # ... existing shutdown event ...

```

Now, I need to update the health check test in `#model_serving/tests/test_app.py` to account for the new asynchronous nature and the mocked call to the feature service.

Made changes.

Okay, the health check is now more comprehensive.

Let's refine the error handling slightly by introducing custom exception classes. This makes it clearer *where* an error originated (e.g., feature fetching vs. model prediction) and allows the API layer to potentially handle them differently if needed in the future, although currently, we map most to standard HTTP exceptions.

I'll create a new file `#model_serving/exceptions.py` for these custom exceptions.

```python
"""Custom exceptions for the model serving application."""

class ModelServingBaseError(Exception):
    """Base exception for this application."""
    pass

class FeatureServiceError(ModelServingBaseError):
    """Error related to the Feature Service interaction."""
    pass

class FeatureNotFoundError(FeatureServiceError, FileNotFoundError):
    """Specific error when features are not found via the Feature Service API."""
    # Inherits from FileNotFoundError for potential compatibility if needed,
    # but primarily signals a feature service issue.
    pass

class FeatureRequestError(FeatureServiceError):
    """Error during the request to the Feature Service (connection, timeout, etc.)."""
    pass

class FeatureResponseError(FeatureServiceError):
    """Error related to the response from the Feature Service (e.g., unexpected format, server error)."""
    pass

class ModelInferenceError(ModelServingBaseError):
    """Error related to the ML model inference process."""
    pass

class InvalidModelInputError(ModelInferenceError, ValueError):
    """Error when the input data provided to the model is invalid."""
    pass

class InvalidModelOutputError(ModelInferenceError, ValueError):
    """Error when the model produces an output in an unexpected format."""
    pass

class ConfigurationError(ModelServingBaseError):
    """Error related to application configuration."""
    pass

```

Now, I'll update `#model_serving/predict.py` to raise these custom exceptions where appropriate.

Made changes.

Okay, I've created the custom exceptions file and updated `predict.py` and `app.py` to use them for more specific error handling.

Now, let's add retry logic to the feature service API call in `#model_serving/predict.py` using the `tenacity` library. This will make the service more resilient to transient network issues or brief unavailability of the feature service.

First, add `tenacity` to the dependencies in `#model_serving/pyproject.toml`.
````
tenacity = "^8.2.0" # For retry logic
````


Made changes.

Okay, the `tenacity` dependency is added. Now, I'll apply the retry decorator to the `get_features_from_api` function in `#model_serving/predict.py`.

We'll configure it to retry on specific errors like connection issues (`FeatureRequestError`) or server-side errors from the feature service (`FeatureResponseError` if it represents a 5xx status), but *not* on errors like `FeatureNotFoundError` (404) or configuration errors. We'll use exponential backoff between retries.

```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **Import `tenacity`:** Imported `retry`, `stop_after_attempt`, `wait_exponential`, and `retry_if_exception_type`.
2.  **Define `should_retry_feature_fetch`:** Created a condition using `retry_if_exception_type` to specify that retries should only happen for `FeatureRequestError` (connection/timeout issues) and `FeatureResponseError` (which we now raise specifically for 5xx errors from the service).
3.  **Apply `@retry` Decorator:** Added the decorator to `get_features_from_api` with:
    *   `stop=stop_after_attempt(3)`: Stop after the 3rd retry (4 attempts total).
    *   `wait=wait_exponential(...)`: Wait 1s, then 2s, then 4s between retries.
    *   `retry=should_retry_feature_fetch`: Use the defined condition.
    *   `reraise=True`: If all retries fail, re-raise the last exception caught.
4.  **Refined Exception Handling:** Adjusted the `try...except` block within `get_features_from_api` slightly:
    *   Explicitly check for `response.status_code >= 500` *before* calling `response.raise_for_status()`. If it's 5xx, we log it and then let `raise_for_status()` raise the `HTTPStatusError`, which is then caught and mapped to `FeatureResponseError` (triggering a retry).
    *   4xx errors (including 404) will now fall through the 5xx check, `raise_for_status()` will raise `HTTPStatusError`, and the `except` block will map 404 to `FeatureNotFoundError` (no retry) and other 4xx errors to `FeatureServiceError` (no retry).

Now, if the feature service is temporarily unavailable or returns a server error (5xx), the `get_features_from_api` function will automatically retry a few times before failing, making the overall prediction service more resilient.

Made changes.

Okay, retry logic has been added to the feature service calls.

The model_serving component is now significantly more robust, scalable, and observable. We've addressed:

*   **Dependency Management:** Using Poetry with locked dependencies.
*   **Configuration:** Centralized and validated using Pydantic-Settings.
*   **Containerization:** Multi-stage Docker build, non-root user, optimized image.
*   **API Design:** Asynchronous endpoints, batch processing support.
*   **Error Handling:** Custom exceptions, clear mapping to HTTP status codes.
*   **Resilience:** Retry logic for critical external API calls (feature service).
*   **Observability:** Structured JSON logging, Prometheus metrics endpoint, enhanced health checks.
*   **Security:** Basic rate limiting.
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for logic, integration tests for API endpoints.

Further areas for production hardening could include:

1.  **Implementing Drift Detection:** Filling in the logic in `drift.py` using appropriate statistical methods and potentially integrating with MLflow Model Monitoring or other tools.
2.  **Adding Custom Metrics:** Using the Prometheus client library directly to add specific business or model-related metrics (e.g., distribution of prediction values, feature service latency).
3.  **Authentication/Authorization:** Implementing security measures if the API needs to be protected (e.g., API keys, OAuth2).
4.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Setting up automated testing, vulnerability scanning, image building, and deployment.
5.  **Enhanced OpenAPI Docs:** Adding more detailed descriptions, examples, and tags to the FastAPI application and Pydantic models for better auto-generated documentation.

Let's enhance the OpenAPI documentation generated by FastAPI by adding tags, descriptions, and examples in `#model_serving/app.py`.

```

**Changes Made:**

1.  **`tags_metadata`:** Defined metadata for organizing endpoints in the docs UI.
2.  **`FastAPI(...)`:** Added `title`, `description`, `version`, and `openapi_tags` to the app instance.
3.  **Pydantic Models:** Added `description` and `example` using `Field(...)` to the model fields for clearer documentation. Created explicit response models (`HealthResponse`, `ModelInfoResponse`) for documentation clarity.
4.  **Endpoints:** Added `tags`, `summary`, `description`, and `response_description` to each endpoint decorator (`@app.get`, `@app.post`).
5.  **`Body(...)` Examples:** Added request body examples directly in the endpoint function signature using `Body(...)`.

Now, when you run the service and access the docs path (FastAPI's default Swagger UI), the documentation will be much more descriptive and user-friendly, showing endpoint organization, descriptions, request/response schemas with examples, etc.

    ```bash
    export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=<your_mlflow_uri>
    export FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=<your_feature_service_url>
    ```
    Replace `<...>` with the actual URIs.
*   **Run the Server:** From the **project root directory** (`ece-gy-9183-mlops-project`), run:
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn model_serving.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

**2. Running with Docker:**

*   **Generate Lock File:** If you haven't already, navigate to the model_serving directory and generate the lock file:
    ```bash
    cd model_serving
    poetry lock
    cd ..
    ```

      agriyield-api
    ```
    Replace `<...>` with the actual URIs. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

hurryingauto3: Update my README with any important information we've added since

GitHub Copilot: Okay, I will update the README.md to include the recent enhancements like using an external feature service API, batch predictions, Prometheus metrics, rate limiting, structured logging, retry logic, and improved documentation/testing.
````
# Model Serving - AgriYield API

This directory contains the code for the FastAPI application that serves the trained AgriYield prediction model.

## Overview

The service exposes a REST API to get yield predictions based on county and year. It loads the appropriate model version from an MLflow Tracking Server and **fetches the required features by calling an external Feature Service API.**

It includes:
*   Single and batch prediction endpoints.
*   Asynchronous request handling.
*   Structured JSON logging (`structlog`).
*   Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`).
*   Rate limiting on prediction endpoints.
*   Retry logic for Feature Service calls.
*   Enhanced health checks.
*   Custom exception handling.
*   Detailed OpenAPI documentation (`/docs`).

## Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

1.  **Install Poetry:** Follow the instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to this directory (`model_serving`) in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This will install all required dependencies, including development dependencies like `pytest`.

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:

*   `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`: The URI of the MLflow Tracking Server where the models are registered.
*   `FEATURE_SERVICE_URL`: **The base URL of the Feature Service API.**
*   `MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME`: (Optional) The name of the model in MLflow. Defaults to `AgriYieldPredictor`.
*   `MLFLOW_MODEL_STAGE`: (Optional) The stage of the model to load (e.g., `Production`, `Staging`). Defaults to `Production`.

You can set these variables directly in your environment or use a `.env` file.

## Running Locally

To run the API server locally for development:

1.  Ensure dependencies are installed (`poetry install`).
2.  Set the required environment variables (e.g., `export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=...`, `export FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=...`).
3.  Run the Uvicorn server from the **project root directory**:
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn model_serving.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and OpenAPI docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Running with Docker

A multi-stage Dockerfile is provided to containerize the application efficiently and securely (non-root user).

1.  **Generate Lock File:** Make sure you have generated the `poetry.lock` file:
    ```bash
    cd model_serving
    poetry lock
    cd ..
    ```
2.  **Build the Image:** From the project root directory:
    ```bash
    docker build -t agriyield-api -f model_serving/Dockerfile .
    ```
3.  **Run the Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 \
      -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=<your_mlflow_uri> \
      -e FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=<your_feature_service_url> \
      agriyield-api
    ```
    Replace `<...>` with your actual URIs.

## API Endpoints

Access the interactive OpenAPI documentation at the `/docs` endpoint when the service is running.

*   **`POST /predict`**: Get a single yield prediction. (Rate limited)
    *   Request Body: `PredictionRequest` (county, year)
    *   Success Response: JSON with county, year, predicted_yield.
*   **`POST /predict_batch`**: Get multiple yield predictions. (Rate limited)
    *   Request Body: `BatchPredictionRequest` (list of `PredictionRequest`)
    *   Success Response: `BatchPredictionResponse` (list of results with optional prediction/error per item).
*   **`GET /health`**: Health check endpoint. Checks model load status and Feature Service connectivity.
    *   Success Response: `{"status": "ok"}`
*   **`GET /model_info`**: Get information about the loaded model.
    *   Success Response: JSON with model name, stage, MLflow URI.
*   **`GET /metrics`**: Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring request counts, latency, errors, etc.

## Testing

Tests are located in the `model_serving/tests` directory and use `pytest`.

*   `test_predict.py`: Unit tests for prediction logic (mocking API calls).
*   `test_app.py`: Integration tests for API endpoints using FastAPI's `TestClient` and `pytest-httpx` for mocking the Feature Service API.

1.  Ensure development dependencies are installed (`poetry install`).
2.  Run tests from the **project root directory**:
    ```bash
    poetry run python -m pytest model_serving/tests/
    ```

## Monitoring & Resilience

*   **Structured Logging:** Logs are output in JSON format using `structlog` for easier parsing and analysis.
*   **Prometheus Metrics:** Key metrics are exposed at `/metrics`.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Prediction endpoints (`/predict`, `/predict_batch`) have rate limits configured using `slowapi`.
*   **Retry Logic:** Calls to the Feature Service API automatically retry on transient errors (connection issues, 5xx responses) using `tenacity`.
*   **Custom Exceptions:** Specific exceptions (`exceptions.py`) are used for clearer error identification.
*   **Drift:** Placeholders for data/concept drift detection exist in `drift.py`.

Made changes.

Okay, the README.md for the model_serving component has been updated to reflect all the recent improvements.

As a next step in enhancing observability, let's add a custom Prometheus metric to specifically track the outcomes within batch prediction requests. We'll add a counter that distinguishes between successful predictions and errors within a batch.

First, I'll add the `prometheus-client` library itself to the dependencies in `#model_serving/pyproject.toml`. While `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` uses it, adding it explicitly makes it clearer and ensures we can import directly from it.
````
prometheus-client = "^0.19.0" # Core client library for custom metrics
````


Made changes.

Okay, the `prometheus-client` dependency is added.

Now, I'll define a custom Prometheus `Counter` in `#model_serving/app.py` and increment it within the `/predict_batch` endpoint to track successful predictions versus errors within each batch request.

```python
# ... other imports ...
from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator
# Import Counter from prometheus_client
from prometheus_client import Counter

# ... (logging, rate limiting setup) ...

# --- API Metadata ---
# ... (tags_metadata) ...

# --- FastAPI App Instance with Metadata ---
# ... (app = FastAPI(...)) ...

# --- Add Rate Limiting State and Middleware/Handler ---
# ... (limiter setup and middleware) ...

# --- Define Custom Prometheus Metrics ---
BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES = Counter(
    "batch_prediction_outcomes_total", # Metric name
    "Counts the outcomes (success/error) of individual predictions within a batch request.", # Description
    ["outcome"] # Label to distinguish success/error
)
# ------------------------------------

# --- Add Prometheus Metrics (including default instrumentator) ---
# Instrument the app *after* adding SlowAPIMiddleware if you don't want blocked requests measured
Instrumentator().instrument(app).expose(app)

@app.post(
    "/predict_batch",
    response_model=BatchPredictionResponse,
    tags=["Predictions"],
    summary="Get multiple yield predictions in batch",

    response_description="A list of prediction results or errors for each item in the batch request."
)
@limiter.limit("5/minute")
async def get_batch_predictions(

            {"county": "CountyA", "year": 2022},
            {"county": "CountyB", "year": 2023}
        ]
    })
):
    # ... (model load check) ...
    # ... (context binding) ...
    try:
        # ... (drift check, call predict_yield_batch) ...
        results = await predict_yield_batch(model, request_dicts)
        logger.info("Batch prediction processing completed")

        # --- Increment Custom Metric ---
        success_count = 0
        failure_count = 0
        for item_result in results:
            if item_result.get("error") is None and item_result.get("predicted_yield") is not None:
                BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES.labels(outcome='success').inc()
                success_count += 1
            else:
                BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES.labels(outcome='error').inc()
                failure_count += 1
        # -------------------------------

        # Log summary (already present)
        logger.info("Batch results summary", success_count=success_count, failure_count=failure_count)

        return BatchPredictionResponse(responses=results)
    # ... (exception handling) ...
    finally:
        structlog.contextvars.unbind_contextvars("batch_size")


# ... (model_info, health_check, shutdown_event) ...

```

**Changes Made:**

1.  **Import `Counter`:** Imported the `Counter` class from `prometheus_client`.
2.  **Define `BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES`:** Created a `Counter` metric named `batch_prediction_outcomes_total` with a description and a single label called `outcome`.
3.  **Increment Counter:** Inside the `/predict_batch` endpoint, after the `predict_yield_batch` function returns, I added a loop that iterates through the `results`. For each item:
    *   If the item has a `predicted_yield` and no `error`, it increments the counter with the label `outcome='success'`.
    *   Otherwise (if there's an error or no prediction), it increments the counter with the label `outcome='error'`.

Now, the `/metrics` endpoint will include lines like:

```
# HELP batch_prediction_outcomes_total Counts the outcomes (success/error) of individual predictions within a batch request.
# TYPE batch_prediction_outcomes_total counter
batch_prediction_outcomes_total{outcome="success"} 15.0

Made changes.

Okay, the custom Prometheus metric for batch outcomes has been added.

Now, let's add some basic implementation to the drift detection placeholders in `#model_serving/drift.py`. This won't be a full drift detection system (which requires baseline statistics from training data and potentially ground truth feedback), but it will illustrate where the logic would go and log relevant information using `structlog`.

```python
# import logging # No longer needed directly
import structlog
from typing import Dict, Any

# Get structlog logger instance
logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

# --- Placeholder for Baseline Statistics ---
# In a real scenario, load this from a file generated during training
# Example: BASELINE_STATS = {"feature1": {"mean": 10.5, "std": 2.1}, "feature2": ...}
BASELINE_STATS = None

    against the training data baseline.

    log = logger.bind(input_data=input_data) # Bind input data for context
    log.info("Performing data drift check (placeholder)...")

    if BASELINE_STATS is None:
        log.warning("Cannot perform data drift check: Baseline statistics not available.")
        return

    # Example Placeholder Logic: Check if keys match baseline, calculate basic stats
    try:
        incoming_keys = set(input_data.keys())
        baseline_keys = set(BASELINE_STATS.keys())

        if incoming_keys != baseline_keys:
            log.warning(
                "Data drift suspected: Input keys mismatch baseline.",
                incoming_keys=sorted(list(incoming_keys)),

def log_prediction_for_monitoring(request_data: Dict[str, Any], prediction: float | None, error: str | None = None):

    if error:
        log.error("Prediction failed")
    else:
        log.info("Prediction successful")

```

Now, I'll update the call to `log_prediction_for_monitoring` in `#model_serving/app.py` to pass the error information correctly when prediction fails within the `/predict` endpoint. The batch endpoint already handles errors internally, so its logging remains focused on the summary.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **`drift.py`:**
    *   Added `structlog` logger.
    *   Included placeholder logic in `check_data_drift` to compare keys and log warnings (actual implementation needs baseline stats).
    *   Added notes in `check_concept_drift` about its typical offline nature.
    *   Updated `log_prediction_for_monitoring` to use `structlog` and accept an optional `error` argument, logging key information.
2.  **`app.py`:**
    *   In the `/predict` endpoint's `finally` block, updated the call to `log_prediction_for_monitoring` to pass both the `prediction_result` (which might be `None` if an error occurred) and the captured `error_message`. This ensures every request outcome is logged for monitoring.
    *   Added comments in `/predict_batch` about optionally logging individual item outcomes using `log_prediction_for_monitoring`, cautioning about potential log volume.

This provides the structure for implementing proper drift detection and ensures that prediction outcomes (including errors) are logged in a structured way suitable for monitoring systems.

Okay, the logging for prediction outcomes is now correctly handled in the `/predict` endpoint.

As a final refinement for observability, let's add a custom Prometheus metric to specifically measure the latency of requests made to the external Feature Service API. This will help diagnose performance issues related to this critical dependency. We'll use a `Histogram` for this, which allows calculating quantiles (like p95, p99 latency).

I'll define the `Histogram` in `#model_serving/app.py` and then modify `#model_serving/predict.py` to observe the latency of the `httpx` call.

First, defining the Histogram in `#model_serving/app.py`:
````
# ... other imports ...
# Import Counter and Histogram from prometheus_client
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

# ... (logging, rate limiting setup) ...

# --- API Metadata ---
# ... (tags_metadata) ...

# --- FastAPI App Instance with Metadata ---
# ... (app = FastAPI(...)) ...

# --- Add Rate Limiting State and Middleware/Handler ---
# ... (limiter setup and middleware) ...

# --- Define Custom Prometheus Metrics ---
BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES = Counter(
    "batch_prediction_outcomes_total",
    "Counts the outcomes (success/error) of individual predictions within a batch request.",
    ["outcome"]
)

FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY = Histogram(
    "feature_service_request_latency_seconds", # Metric name
    "Latency of requests to the Feature Service API.", # Description
    # Define buckets for latency histogram (e.g., 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms, 1s, 5s, 10s)
    buckets=[0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, float("inf")]
)
# ------------------------------------

# --- Add Prometheus Metrics (including default instrumentator) ---
# ... (Instrumentator setup) ...

# ... (Model loading, middleware, Pydantic models, endpoints ...) ...

````


Made changes.

Okay, now I will modify `#model_serving/predict.py` to import the `FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY` histogram and use its `.observe()` method to record the duration of the `httpx` call to the feature service.

Okay, the custom metric for feature service latency has been added and integrated.

Let's refine the configuration further by making parameters like rate limits, retry attempts, and timeouts configurable via environment variables instead of being hardcoded. We'll add these to the `Settings` model in `#model_serving/mlflow_loader.py`.

```python
# ... other imports ...
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict
from pydantic import HttpUrl, Field # Import Field
from typing import List # Import List

# ... (logger setup) ...

class MlflowSettings(BaseSettings):
    # ... existing settings ...

class FeatureServiceSettings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_prefix='FEATURE_SERVICE_')
    url: HttpUrl
    # Add timeout configuration
    timeout_seconds: float = Field(10.0, description="Timeout for requests to the feature service.")
    # Add retry configuration
    retry_attempts: int = Field(3, description="Number of retry attempts for feature service calls.")
    retry_min_wait_seconds: int = Field(1, description="Minimum wait time (seconds) between retries.")
    retry_max_wait_seconds: int = Field(5, description="Maximum wait time (seconds) between retries.")

class ApiSettings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_prefix='API_')
    # Add rate limit configuration (example: "10/minute")
    predict_limit: str = Field("10/minute", description="Rate limit for the /predict endpoint.")
    predict_batch_limit: str = Field("5/minute", description="Rate limit for the /predict_batch endpoint.")

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    mlflow: MlflowSettings = MlflowSettings()
    feature_service: FeatureServiceSettings = FeatureServiceSettings()
    api: ApiSettings = ApiSettings() # Add API settings
    # Add other settings sections if needed

# Load settings instance
try:
    settings = Settings()
    mlflow.set_tracking_uri(settings.mlflow.tracking_uri)
    logger.info(
        "Settings loaded",
        mlflow_tracking_uri=settings.mlflow.tracking_uri,
        feature_service_url=str(settings.feature_service.url),
        feature_service_timeout=settings.feature_service.timeout_seconds,
        feature_service_retries=settings.feature_service.retry_attempts,
        api_predict_limit=settings.api.predict_limit,
        api_batch_limit=settings.api.predict_batch_limit,
    )
except Exception as e:
    logger.error("Failed to load settings or set MLflow tracking URI", error=str(e), exc_info=True)
    settings = None

# ... (load_model function remains the same) ...

```

Now, I'll update `#model_serving/app.py` and `#model_serving/predict.py` to use these settings from the `settings` object instead of hardcoded values.

Updating `#model_serving/app.py` for rate limits:

```python
# ... other imports ...

These changes make the service's behavior (rate limits, timeouts, retries) more easily configurable through environment variables (e.g., `API_PREDICT_LIMIT="20/minute"`, `FEATURE_SERVICE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15`, `FEATURE_SERVICE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=5`) without needing code changes.

Okay, the configuration settings are now externalized.

As a further refinement to improve testability and adhere to FastAPI best practices, let's use dependency injection for the loaded ML model instead of relying on a global variable. This makes it easier to provide mock models during testing.

First, I'll modify `#model_serving/mlflow_loader.py` to remove the global `model` variable and adjust `load_model` slightly (though its core logic remains). We'll also add a dependency function to provide the loaded model.

```python
# ... other imports ...
from model_serving.exceptions import ConfigurationError, ModelServingBaseError # Import exceptions

# ... (logger setup) ...
# ... (Settings classes and loading logic remains the same) ...

# --- Model Loading Function ---
def load_ml_model():
    """
    Loads the ML model from MLflow based on configuration settings.
    Raises ConfigurationError if settings are missing, or ModelServingBaseError if loading fails.

Made changes.

Okay, the dependency injection setup is complete and the tests have been updated accordingly.

As a final step in enhancing observability, let's add one more custom Prometheus metric: a histogram to track the distribution of the predicted yield values. This can help monitor the model's output range over time.

I'll define the `Histogram` in `#model_serving/app.py` and then observe the predicted values in the `/predict` and `/predict_batch` endpoints.

First, defining the new Histogram in `#model_serving/app.py`:
````
# ... other imports ...
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

# ... (logging, rate limiting setup) ...

# --- API Metadata ---
# ... (tags_metadata) ...

# --- FastAPI App Instance with Metadata ---
# ... (app = FastAPI(...)) ...

# --- Add Rate Limiting State and Middleware/Handler ---
# ... (limiter setup and middleware) ...

# --- Define Custom Prometheus Metrics ---
BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES = Counter(
    # ... (existing counter definition) ...
)

FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY = Histogram(
    # ... (existing histogram definition) ...
)

PREDICTED_YIELD_DISTRIBUTION = Histogram(
    "predicted_yield_distribution", # Metric name
    "Distribution of predicted yield values.", # Description
    # Define buckets appropriate for expected yield range
    # Example: 0-10, 10-20, ..., 90-100, >100
    buckets=[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, float("inf")]
)

Okay, the custom metric for predicted yield distribution has been added.

As a final step for improving scalability and performance under load, let's configure Uvicorn to run with multiple worker processes. This allows the service to handle multiple requests concurrently, making better use of available CPU cores.

I'll update the `CMD` instruction in the `#model_serving/Dockerfile` to include the `--workers` flag, making the number of workers configurable via an environment variable `UVICORN_WORKERS`.

```dockerfile
# ... (Stage 1: Builder remains the same) ...

# Stage 2: Runtime
# ... (FROM, ARG USER/GROUP/UID/GID, RUN groupadd/useradd, WORKDIR /app) ...

# ... (COPY requirements.txt, RUN pip install) ...

# ... (COPY application code) ...

# Set environment variables
ENV MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=${MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}
ENV FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=${FEATURE_SERVICE_URL}
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app
# Add environment variable for number of workers (default to 2 if not set)
ENV UVICORN_WORKERS=${UVICORN_WORKERS:-2}

# ... (RUN chown, USER ${USER}) ...

EXPOSE 8000

# --- Update CMD to use multiple workers ---
# Use the $UVICORN_WORKERS environment variable
CMD [\"uvicorn\", \"model_serving.app:app\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"8000\", \"--workers\", \"${UVICORN_WORKERS}\"]
```

Now, I'll update the `#model_serving/README.md` to mention this multi-worker configuration and the new environment variable.

```markdown
# ... (Overview, Setup sections) ...

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables to be set:

*   `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`: The URI of the MLflow Tracking Server.
*   `FEATURE_SERVICE_URL`: The base URL of the Feature Service API.
*   `MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME`: (Optional) Defaults to `AgriYieldPredictor`.
*   `MLFLOW_MODEL_STAGE`: (Optional) Defaults to `Production`.
*   `API_PREDICT_LIMIT`: (Optional) Rate limit for `/predict`. Defaults to `10/minute`.
*   `API_PREDICT_BATCH_LIMIT`: (Optional) Rate limit for `/predict_batch`. Defaults to `5/minute`.
*   `FEATURE_SERVICE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: (Optional) Timeout for feature service calls. Defaults to `10.0`.
*   `FEATURE_SERVICE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`: (Optional) Number of retries for feature service. Defaults to `3`.
*   `FEATURE_SERVICE_RETRY_MIN_WAIT_SECONDS`: (Optional) Min wait between retries. Defaults to `1`.
*   `FEATURE_SERVICE_RETRY_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS`: (Optional) Max wait between retries. Defaults to `5`.
*   `UVICORN_WORKERS`: (Optional) Number of Uvicorn worker processes. Defaults to `2`. **Set based on available CPU cores (e.g., `2 * num_cores + 1`) for production.**

You can set these variables directly in your environment or use a `.env` file.

## Running Locally

# ... (Instructions remain the same, Uvicorn runs with --reload which uses 1 worker) ...

## Running with Docker

# ... (Build instructions remain the same) ...

3.  **Run the Container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 \\
      -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=<your_mlflow_uri> \\
      -e FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=<your_feature_service_url> \\
      # Optionally set other config variables, e.g.:
      # -e UVICORN_WORKERS=4 \\
      agriyield-api
    ```
    Replace `<...>` with your actual URIs. **The container now runs Uvicorn with multiple worker processes (default 2, configurable via `UVICORN_WORKERS`) for better concurrency.**

# ... (API Endpoints, Testing, Monitoring & Resilience sections) ...

```

This completes the configuration for running multiple Uvicorn workers within the Docker container, enhancing the service's ability to handle concurrent requests. You can adjust the default or set the `UVICORN_WORKERS` environment variable based on the resources available in your deployment environment.

In your `docker run` command, you passed the literal string `"your_feature_service_url"`:

```bash

  -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=your_mlflow_uri \
  -e FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=your_feature_service_url \  # <-- Problem here

```

You need to replace `"your_feature_service_url"` with the actual, valid URL of the feature service API you intend to connect to. For example:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://actual-mlflow-uri:5000 \
  -e FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=http://actual-feature-service-url:9000 \
  agriyield-api
```

Make sure the URL starts with `http://` or `https://`.

hurryingauto3: I dont have an ML Flow server setup yet. I want to test if my service will run. Help me comment out checks that might cause this to fail

GitHub Copilot: Okay, to allow the service to start without a running MLflow server, we need to bypass the parts that interact directly with MLflow during startup. Prediction endpoints will still fail later because no model is loaded, but the server itself should launch.

1.  **Comment out MLflow interactions in mlflow_loader.py:**
    *   Prevent setting the tracking URI.
    *   Prevent the actual model loading call and make `load_ml_model` return `None`.

```python
# ... other imports ...

# ... (logger setup) ...
# ... (Settings classes) ...

# Load settings instance - reads from environment variables
try:
    settings = Settings()
    # --- Comment out MLflow URI setting ---
    # mlflow.set_tracking_uri(settings.mlflow.tracking_uri)
    # --- Log that it's skipped ---
    logger.info("Skipping MLflow tracking URI setup for testing.")
    # ------------------------------------
    # ... (rest of the logging) ...
except Exception as e:
    # ... (existing error handling) ...
    settings = None

# --- Model Loading Function ---
def load_ml_model():
    """
    Loads the ML model from MLflow based on configuration settings.
    Raises ConfigurationError if settings are missing, or ModelServingBaseError if loading fails.
    """
    if not settings:
        logger.error("Cannot load model: Settings are not available.")
        raise ConfigurationError("MLflow settings are not configured.")

    try:
        uri = f"models:/{settings.mlflow.model_name}/{settings.mlflow.model_stage}"
        logger.info("Attempting to load model from MLflow (call commented out)", model_uri=uri)
        # --- Comment out actual MLflow call ---
        # model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(uri)
        # --- Return None instead ---
        model = None
        logger.warning("MLflow model loading skipped for testing, returning None.")
        # ---------------------------
        # if model is None: # This check is now redundant
        #      raise ModelServingBaseError("mlflow.pyfunc.load_model returned None")
        return model
    except Exception as e:
        # This block might still catch errors if uri creation fails, etc.
        logger.error("Error during model loading preparation", error=str(e), exc_info=True)
        raise ModelServingBaseError(f"Failed during model loading preparation: {e}") from e

# ... (Initial model load and get_model dependency function remain the same) ...
# loaded_model_instance will be None if the above changes are made
# get_model will correctly raise ModelServingBaseError if loaded_model_instance is None
```

2.  **Modify `/model_info` endpoint in app.py:**
    *   Return dummy data as the MLflow settings might be unavailable or invalid if a dummy URI was used.

```python
# ... other imports ...

# ... (logging, rate limiting, API metadata, app instance, middleware, metrics) ...
# ... (Pydantic Models) ...
# ... (Prediction Endpoints) ...

@app.get(
    "/model_info",
    response_model=ModelInfoResponse,
    tags=["Service Info"],
    summary="Get loaded model information",
    description="Returns details about the ML model currently loaded by the service.",
    response_description="Information about the loaded model."
)
def model_info():
    # --- Return dummy data as MLflow connection is bypassed ---
    logger.info("Returning dummy model info as MLflow connection is bypassed.")
    return {
        "model_name": "N/A (MLflow bypassed)",
        "model_stage": "N/A (MLflow bypassed)",
        "mlflow_uri": settings.mlflow.tracking_uri if settings and settings.mlflow else "N/A (MLflow bypassed)"
    }
    # ---------------------------------------------------------

    # if not settings:
    #      raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, detail="Configuration not loaded.")
    # return {
    #     "model_name": settings.mlflow.model_name,
    #     "model_stage": settings.mlflow.model_stage,
    #     "mlflow_uri": settings.mlflow.tracking_uri
    # }

# ... (Health Check, Exception Handler, Shutdown Event) ...
```

**Important:**

*   You still need to provide **dummy environment variables** for `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` and `FEATURE_SERVICE_URL` when running the service (locally or via Docker), otherwise, the settings validation might fail. Use valid-looking URLs like `http://dummy-mlflow` and `http://dummy-features`.
*   With these changes, the service should *start*, but the `/predict` and `/predict_batch` endpoints will return HTTP 503 errors because the `get_model` dependency will raise an error indicating the model is unavailable.
*   The `/health` check will also likely fail and return 503 because it depends on `get_model`.

This allows you to test the basic API structure, routing, logging, metrics, etc., without needing a live MLflow connection. Remember to undo these changes when you want to connect to a real MLflow server.

Made changes.

Okay, the necessary code changes have been made to bypass the MLflow connection during startup.

You should now be able to run the service locally or via Docker to test its basic functionality (like routing, logging, metrics endpoint).

Remember to:

1.  Provide **dummy but valid-looking URLs** for the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` and `FEATURE_SERVICE_URL` environment variables when you run the service (e.g., `http://dummy-mlflow`, `http://dummy-features`).
2.  Expect the `/predict` and `/predict_batch` endpoints to return errors (likely HTTP 503) because no actual model is loaded.
3.  Expect the `/health` check to also fail (return HTTP 503) for the same reason.

This setup allows you to verify the service starts and responds on other endpoints without needing the full MLflow infrastructure running. Remember to revert these changes when you want to connect to a real MLflow server and load the model.

    Some wierd syntax errors here

GitHub Copilot: You are absolutely right! It seems like there was a copy-paste error or corruption in that section of mlflow_loader.py.

Let's fix the syntax for the initial model loading and the `get_model` dependency function.

```python
# ... other imports ...
# ... logger setup ...
# ... Settings classes ...
# ... settings loading try/except block ...

# --- Model Loading Function ---
def load_ml_model():
    # ... existing function definition ...

# --- Load model instance at startup ---
# We still load it once, but store it for the dependency function
# Handle potential errors during initial load
try:
    loaded_model_instance = load_ml_model()
    # logger.info("Initial model load successful.") # Logged inside load_ml_model now if successful
except (ConfigurationError, ModelServingBaseError) as e:
    logger.critical("CRITICAL: Initial model load failed during startup.", error=str(e), exc_info=True)
    # Depending on desired behavior, could exit here or let endpoints fail
    loaded_model_instance = None
    # Consider exiting: import sys; sys.exit(1)

        logger.error("Model requested but not available (initial load failed).")
        raise ModelServingBaseError("Model is not available due to loading error.")
    return loaded_model_instance
```

I will apply this correction to the file.

    from model_serving.app import FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY
ImportError: cannot import name 'FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY' from partially initialized module 'model_serving.app' (most likely due to a circular import) (/app/model_serving/app.py)

GitHub Copilot: You've encountered a circular import error. This is happening because:

1.  app.py defines the Prometheus metrics (like `FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY`) and also imports `async_client` from predict.py.
2.  predict.py imports `FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY` from app.py.

This creates a loop: app.py needs predict.py before it's fully defined, and predict.py needs app.py before *it's* fully defined.

To fix this, we should move the metric definitions to a separate file.

**1. Create `model_serving/metrics.py`**

I'll create a new file to hold the Prometheus metric definitions.

```python
"""Definitions for custom Prometheus metrics."""

from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

# --- Define Custom Prometheus Metrics ---
BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES = Counter(
    "batch_prediction_outcomes_total", # Metric name
    "Counts the outcomes (success/error) of individual predictions within a batch request.", # Description
    ["outcome"] # Label to distinguish success/error
)

FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY = Histogram(
    "feature_service_request_latency_seconds", # Metric name
    "Latency of requests to the Feature Service API.", # Description
    # Define buckets for latency histogram (e.g., 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms, 1s, 5s, 10s)
    buckets=[0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, float("inf")]
)

PREDICTED_YIELD_DISTRIBUTION = Histogram(
    "predicted_yield_distribution", # Metric name
    "Distribution of predicted yield values.", # Description
    # Define buckets appropriate for expected yield range
    # Example: 0-10, 10-20, ..., 90-100, >100
    buckets=[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, float("inf")]
)
# ------------------------------------
```

**2. Update app.py**

I'll remove the metric definitions from app.py and import them from the new `metrics.py` file.

```python
# ... other imports ...
from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator
# --- Remove direct prometheus_client import ---
# from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram
# --- Import metrics from the new module ---
from model_serving.metrics import (

    FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY, # Keep import if needed elsewhere in app.py (currently not)
    PREDICTED_YIELD_DISTRIBUTION
)
# ... other imports ...

# ... (logging, rate limiting setup) ...
# ... (API Metadata) ...
# ... (FastAPI App Instance) ...

        # --- Observe prediction value ---
        if prediction_result is not None:
            PREDICTED_YIELD_DISTRIBUTION.observe(prediction_result) # Use imported metric
        # --------------------------------
    # ... (exception handling) ...

@app.post(
    "/predict_batch",
    # ... (endpoint decorator details) ...
)
# ... (endpoint function signature) ...
    # ... (try block) ...
        for item_result in results:
            predicted_yield = item_result.get("predicted_yield")
            if item_result.get("error") is None and predicted_yield is not None:
                BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES.labels(outcome='success').inc() # Use imported metric
                PREDICTED_YIELD_DISTRIBUTION.observe(predicted_yield) # Use imported metric
                success_count += 1
            else:
                BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES.labels(outcome='error').inc() # Use imported metric
                failure_count += 1
    # ... (exception handling) ...

# ... (model_info, health_check, exception_handler, shutdown_event) ...

```

**3. Update predict.py**

I'll change the import in predict.py to get `FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY` from `metrics.py`.

```python
# ... other imports ...
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential, retry_if_exception_type
# --- Import the custom metric from metrics module ---
from model_serving.metrics import FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY
# --- Remove import from app ---
# from model_serving.app import FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY

# ... (logger setup, async_client) ...
# ... (retry conditions) ...
# ... (retry decorator) ...

async def get_features_from_api(county: str, year: int) -> dict | None:
    # ... (function logic remains the same, uses imported FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY) ...
    # --- Observe latency after successful call (before potential errors) ---
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY.observe(duration) # Uses metric imported from metrics.py
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------
    # ... (rest of function) ...

# ... (predict_yield function remains the same) ...
# ... (predict_yield_batch function remains the same) ...
```

These changes break the circular import by having both app.py and predict.py depend on the new `metrics.py` file, which doesn't depend on either of them.

I will now apply these changes.

Made changes.

It appears the circular import error is still occurring, even though the previous edits should have resolved it by moving the metric definitions to `metrics.py` and updating the imports in app.py and predict.py.

The traceback indicates that when the container starts, predict.py is still trying to import `FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY` from app.py:

```
File "/app/model_serving/predict.py", line 17, in <module>
    from model_serving.app import FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY
ImportError: cannot import name 'FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY' from partially initialized module 'model_serving.app' (most likely due to a circular import) (/app/model_serving/app.py)
```

This most likely means that the Docker image being run (`agriyield-api`) was built *before* the fix was applied to predict.py, and Docker is using a cached layer.

To ensure the latest code changes are included in the image, please rebuild the Docker image using the `--no-cache` flag:

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t agriyield-api -f model_serving/Dockerfile .
```

After rebuilding the image, try running the container again with your dummy environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://dummy-mlflow \
  -e FEATURE_SERVICE_URL=http://dummy-features \
  agriyield-api
```

This should resolve the `ImportError`.

hurryingauto3: Can you explain why I need features when I try to predict some output from my model ?

GitHub Copilot: Okay, let's break down why features are essential for making predictions with your model.

Think of your trained machine learning model (like `AgriYieldPredictor`) as a complex function or a recipe it learned during training.

1.  **Training:** When you trained the model, you didn't just show it the `county`, `year`, and the final `yield`. You showed it a set of **features** for each county/year combination – things like:
    *   Average rainfall during the growing season
    *   Average temperature
    *   Soil type indicators
    *   Historical yield trends for that county
    *   Types of crops grown
    *   Maybe economic factors
    *   ... and so on.
    The model learned the intricate relationships and patterns between *these specific features* and the resulting `yield`.

2.  **Prediction:** Now, when you want to predict the yield for a *new* county and year, the model needs the **exact same kind of information** it was trained on to apply the patterns it learned.
    *   It doesn't inherently know the yield just from the names "SampleCounty" and "2024".
    *   It needs the *values* for rainfall, temperature, soil type, etc. (the features) corresponding to "SampleCounty" in "2024".

3.  **Your Code's Role:**
    *   Your API endpoint (`/predict`) takes the `county` and `year` as convenient inputs for the user.
    *   The `get_features_from_api` function in [`predict.py`](predict.py ) then acts as a lookup step. It takes the `county` and `year` and queries your Feature Service.
    *   The Feature Service provides the actual feature values (rainfall, temperature, etc.) associated with that specific county and year.
    *   Finally, the `predict_yield` function takes these fetched features, formats them correctly (usually into a DataFrame like `input_df`), and passes *those features* to `model.predict()`.

In short, **features are the actual input variables the model understands and uses to calculate the prediction**, based on the relationships it learned during training. The `county` and `year` you provide to the API are just keys to retrieve those necessary features.

hurryingauto3: but isnt the model then just outputting its training data? How can I predict yeilf for 2025 if my data ends at 2023?

GitHub Copilot: That's a great question, and it gets to the heart of how predictive models work (and their limitations).

You're right, the model doesn't *know* the actual yield for 2025. It also isn't (or shouldn't be, if trained well) just memorizing the 2023 yield and spitting it back out.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Learning Relationships:** During training (on data up to 2023), the model learned the *relationship* between the input features (rainfall, temperature, soil type, etc.) and the resulting yield. It learned patterns like "when rainfall is X and temperature is Y in this type of county, the yield tends to be Z".

2.  **Requiring Future Features:** To predict for 2025, the model needs the *input features* for 2025 for the specific county. This is the crucial step. Your `get_features_from_api` function calls the Feature Service asking for features for `county="SomeCounty", year=2025`.

3.  **Feature Service's Role:** The Feature Service is responsible for providing those 2025 features. How does *it* know them?
    *   **Projections/Estimates:** It likely uses forecasting methods, climate models, historical trends, or assumptions to *estimate* what the rainfall, temperature, etc., *might be* in 2025.
    *   **Known Future Data:** Some features might be known or planned (e.g., planned crop rotations).
    *   **Stable Features:** Some features might be assumed to be stable (e.g., basic soil type).

4.  **Applying Learned Patterns:** Once your `predict_yield` function gets the *estimated 2025 features* from the Feature Service, it feeds them into the model. The model then applies the patterns and relationships it learned from the pre-2023 data to these *new, estimated 2025 features* to calculate a predicted yield for 2025.

**In essence:**

*   The model provides the *learned function* (how features relate to yield).
*   The Feature Service provides the *estimated input values* for the future year.
*   The prediction is the result of applying the learned function to the estimated future inputs.

**Limitations:**

*   The accuracy of the 2025 prediction heavily depends on the **accuracy of the 2025 feature estimates** provided by the Feature Service. If the rainfall projection for 2025 is wrong, the yield prediction will likely be off.
*   It assumes the **relationships learned from the past still hold true** in the future. If some fundamental factor changes drastically between 2023 and 2025 (a new farming technique, a major climate event unlike past ones), the model's prediction might be inaccurate (this is called concept drift).


Okay, let's compare your model_serving codebase with the evaluation and monitoring techniques presented in the tutorials.

**Alignment with Tutorials:**

*   **Operational Metrics:** You are using `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` (`app.py`), which aligns well with the tutorial's approach for basic web service metrics (request counts, latency, status codes) exposed via a `/metrics` endpoint.
*   **Custom Metrics:** You have defined custom Prometheus metrics in metrics.py (`FEATURE_SERVICE_LATENCY`, `PREDICTED_YIELD_DISTRIBUTION`, `BATCH_PREDICTION_OUTCOMES`) and are observing them in `predict.py` and app.py. This matches the tutorial's concept of monitoring application-specific metrics like prediction distributions and dependency latency.
*   **Structured Logging:** The use of `structlog` (`app.py`) for JSON logging is good practice and aids monitoring, aligning with the general principle of having observable systems.
*   **Health Checks:** The `/health` endpoint (`app.py`) checks for service availability and dependency (Feature Service) connectivity, similar to basic service health monitoring.
*   **Resilience:** Features like rate limiting (`slowapi` in app.py) and retry logic for the feature service (`tenacity` in `predict.py`) contribute to a more robust and monitorable service.
*   **Containerization:** Using Docker (`Dockerfile`, README.md) aligns with the tutorial's use of containers for deployment and monitoring infrastructure (like Prometheus, Grafana, cAdvisor).

**Gaps and Differences:**

*   **Offline Evaluation:**
    *   The tutorials demonstrate comprehensive offline evaluation (general metrics, slices, robustness tests, failure modes, explainability) typically performed *before* deployment, often in notebooks or dedicated evaluation scripts.
    *   Your tests directory (`README.md`) contains unit and integration tests, which are essential but likely focus on API correctness and component interaction rather than the broader model performance evaluation aspects covered in the *Offline Evaluation* tutorial. These more extensive model evaluations might reside in your eval.py or require dedicated scripts/notebooks.
*   **Data Drift Detection:**
    *   The *Online Evaluation* tutorial implements data drift detection using `alibi-detect` and MMD, saving the detector, loading it in the app, running checks asynchronously, and adding specific Prometheus metrics for drift.
    *   Your drift.py contains placeholder functions (`check_data_drift`, `check_concept_drift`). While app.py calls `check_data_drift`, it appears to be calling a non-functional stub based on the content of drift.py. The root README.md notes monitoring for data drift as a goal.
*   **Concept Drift Detection:**
    *   Your drift.py correctly identifies this as a placeholder requiring ground truth, likely processed offline. The tutorial didn't explicitly cover implementing concept drift but focused on online monitoring that could *signal* potential concept drift (e.g., degrading prediction metrics).
*   **Prediction Confidence/Uncertainty:**
    *   The tutorial monitored prediction confidence (for a classification task). Your task is regression (yield prediction). While direct confidence isn't applicable, monitoring the *distribution* (`PREDICTED_YIELD_DISTRIBUTION`) is a good start. You aren't currently monitoring model uncertainty if your model provides it.
*   **Infrastructure Monitoring (cAdvisor):**
    *   The tutorial explicitly adds cAdvisor to the Docker Compose setup to monitor container resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) and visualizes this in Grafana. Your application code doesn't include this (as expected), but it needs to be part of your deployment configuration (Docker Compose or Kubernetes).
*   **Monitoring Dashboards & Alerting:**
    *   The tutorial demonstrates building Grafana dashboards and setting up alerts based on Prometheus metrics. While your app exposes the metrics, the dashboard creation and alerting configuration are external steps, typically done in Grafana/Alertmanager.

**Next Steps to Align and Enhance:**

1.  **Implement Data Drift Detection:**
    *   Replace the placeholder `check_data_drift` in drift.py with a functional implementation using a library like `alibi-detect` or `evidently.ai`. Choose a suitable algorithm for your tabular/time-series features (e.g., MMD, KS).
    *   Define reference data (from training/validation set) needed by the detector.
    *   Consider saving/loading the detector as shown in the tutorial.
    *   Ensure the asynchronous execution in app.py calls the functional detector.
    *   Add Prometheus metrics (e.g., `drift_detected_total`, `drift_test_statistic_value`) in metrics.py and observe them in your drift detection logic.
2.  **Strengthen Offline Evaluation (Likely in model_training):**
    *   Review or create evaluation scripts/notebooks (e.g., enhancing eval.py) to incorporate tests from the *Offline Evaluation* tutorial:
        *   Evaluation on specific data slices (e.g., different counties, years with extreme weather).
        *   Evaluation against known failure modes for yield prediction.
        *   Robustness tests (e.g., perturbing input features).
    *   Consider integrating these into a `pytest` suite run as part of your CI/CD pipeline after model training.
3.  **Develop Monitoring Dashboards & Alerts:**
    *   Create Grafana dashboards to visualize operational, custom, and (once implemented) drift metrics. Consider exporting dashboard JSON definitions for version control, as shown in the tutorial.
    *   Configure alerts in Grafana/Alertmanager for critical conditions (high errors/latency, detected drift, anomalous prediction distributions, high resource usage).
4.  **Ensure Infrastructure Monitoring:**
    *   Verify that cAdvisor (or equivalent) is included in your deployment manifests (e.g., `docker-compose-prometheus.yaml` if using Compose, or Kubernetes manifests) and that Prometheus is configured to scrape it.
5.  **Develop Concept Drift Strategy:**
    *   Plan how ground truth (actual yield data) will be collected and associated with past predictions.
    *   Implement the `check_concept_drift` logic in drift.py to compare prediction errors over time against a baseline.
    *   Design a process (e.g., batch job, separate service) to run these checks periodically when ground truth is available.
